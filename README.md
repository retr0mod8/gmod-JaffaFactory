Repository for [gm_jaffa_factory](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2514311238) & [ttt_jaffa_factory](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539476811)\
This repository contains assets used to create the map, including but not limited to: Unconverted Textures/Audio/Models, Converted Textures/Audio/Models, and Maps for each day of development.\
Textures/3D Models/Sounds from PureBDcraft ResourcePack by https://bdcraft.net

## How to setup?
You will first need to extract the assets from 'MOUNT_SANBOX.ZIP' or 'MOUNT_TTT.7Z' to the root folder in your Garry's Mod installation. This will allow the assets to be used via Hammer Editor and in-game.\
Second, you'll need to launch Hammer Editor from the 'bin' folder in your Garry's Mod Installation. Next, you'll need to open a .vmf file from one of the .zip files within the 'Map files' folder. The 'un-resized'
variants of the map files is a version of the map before being resized by 0.6. The 'resized' variant of the maps are those maps after that process.

## Why do the maps need to be rescaled?
This is because it's easier to built in 64hu x 64hu grids, then resizing down to 38.4, then to manually move and resize brushes in 38.4hu x 38.4hu grids. Once finished with the un-resized version, 
turn on 'Texture Lock' and 'Scaling Texture Lock', click 'Tools' > 'Transform' > 'Scale', then put '0.6' in all 3 number boxes. 

## Licensing
If you plan to re-distribute this map with any assets from BDCraft.net, you'll need to credit them. More can be read [here](https://bdcraft.net/downloads/purebdcraft-minecraft/#download) by clicking on 'click to view Terms of Use'\
Additional atribution to creators of mod texture packs may be required aswell. The creators of all textures in this repository can be found in the description of the [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2514311238#highlightContent).\
